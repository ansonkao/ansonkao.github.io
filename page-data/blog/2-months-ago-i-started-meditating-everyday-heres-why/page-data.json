I knew a few people that were interested in it, but instead of taking the chance to participate with them and learn together, I silently judged them. “Hippies, all of you! Get a fucking job and do something productive… <strong>spits</strong>” 😒</p>\n<p>My good friend Dien changed that for me in July of 2017. We had gone on a trip to Utah/Arizona together. He and I were both soul-searching and we took our questions about life to the great sandstone parks: Zion, Bryce, Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Valley, Grand Canyon. This is one of my favourite destinations in the world and I intend to return many times in my life. Aside from some powerful revelations we had there (which needs its own post), the canyons were a brilliant environment for meditation and it didn’t take a devotee to realize that. Dien lead a couple guided sessions with me, and we captured this time lapse of us in the Grand Canyon:</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Z9rC9e2E4k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p>From this experience, I now knew the basic mechanics of meditation, and the practice was now a little less foreign / a little more approachable. So after we got back from that trip, I tried tried using Calm.com / Headspace for a few minutes each day to keep the ball rolling. Focus on your breath, become aware of your body, and relax; seems simple enough, right? Sadly though, I gave up after a few attempts, because I still didn’t REALLY get why I was doing it. If I want to relax, why don’t I just take a nap or watch something funny? 🤷‍♂️</p>\n<h3>Fast forward to 3 months ago (2 years later)</h3>\n<p>I got into a brutal fight with my girlfriend 😱🥵. The exact details of the fight could be it’s own post, so I’ll just summarize my takeaways from the fight like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>I need to figure out how to be less stubborn. I have to do this quickly (a) if I want to succeed in business and (b) if I want my relationship to feel more like paradise than like prison.</h1>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a really, really bad fight. Tears were shed. I felt demoralized and scared for my own future, and for my girlfriend’s as well. But I was determined to do something about it, so I did what any reasonable human being would do in this day and age: I googled <strong><em>“How to become less stubborn”</em></strong> and stayed up late crawling down the rabbit hole. The quality of the search results were not the greatest: a lot of Yahoo! Answers, listicles, and emotional ranting on various social networks (but I will concede that there was no porn 🤣). In my desperation, I even emailed a few of the spiritually inclined (<em>cough</em> hippie <em>cough</em>) people I found. Was this a new low in my life? 😖</p>\n<p>Then, two things happened in the weeks that followed that felt like striking gold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I was reading an e-book called “<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit\">The Great CEO Within</a>” by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mattmochary\">Matt Mochary</a>. This book basically catalogues and humanizes the various challenges that successful entrepreneurs go through. Turns out stubbornness is a very common challenge, even amongst (perhaps <em>especially</em> amongst) the greatest leaders. So much so, that this topic has its own separate book called “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable/dp/0990976904/\">The 15 Commitments of the Conscious Leadership</a>” listed in the Further Reading section. I immediately bought it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The random dude that I emailed responded, with a 5000 character essay. WOW! I’ve been keeping in touch with him since, exchanging a few emails here and there.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can you guess what both the books and my new pen pal pointed me to as the solution for stubbornness?</p>\n<h2>Meditation is the antidote</h2>\n<p>Finally, I understood why I need to meditate. It’s not about relaxing — it’s about TRAINING. Teaching your mind to handle things differently, and developing a stronger mental self-awareness. Furthermore, stubbornness is just the mind handling new information poorly. So, meditation is the perfect approach with which to tackle stubbornness.</p>\n<p>Turns out this is a journey I’ve already been on for several years, just in a passive way where I would observe my own misgivings with no way to convert the feedback into something actionable. Now, armed with meditation, I have a way to push forward deliberately and on a daily basis.</p>\n<h3>What does success look like?</h3>\n<p>It only became clear to me that meditation really is the solution when I saw it described this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>You can’t prevent a thought or emotion from appearing in your head. But you can learn to shift away from it faster.</h1>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, that “saint” we all admire — that one person every group of friends has that just somehow always seems calm — they still have unwieldy thoughts. They just get past them WAY faster than the rest of us. That’s what I want for myself, in business, in romance, and in all aspects of life — to get past my emotions faster, and make good decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>So I made a lifetime commitment to daily meditation.</strong> In August, I meditated 5 minutes every morning. In September, I increased it to 10 minutes. <strong><em>Armed with this new motivation to be a better leader, I was now able to get past the mental hurdles that I had with meditation 2 years ago and stick to the routine.</em></strong></p>\n<p>It’s still very early on in this journey, and it’s hard to measure progress objectively. But I am already finding some signs of improvement with how I handle emotions. Instead of getting triggered by something and acting dismissive to people for hours, I’m now calling myself out within a few minutes. With time, that recovery period will be down to 5 seconds <em>#superpowers⚡</em>️.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2240/1*-76K6-vIkHC6bR0sMMGZ7A.png\"><figcaption>Meditating in the Grand Canyon</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h2>Shoutouts 🙏</h2>\n<p>To Dien, who just got back from a 10-day Vipassana retreat today: thanks for your leadership in this all, gonna be leaning on you more for this <em>#brainsurgery</em>.
