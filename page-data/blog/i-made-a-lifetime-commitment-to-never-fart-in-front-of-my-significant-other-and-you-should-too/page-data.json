Not until you’re married or moved in together? Only on days you didn’t eat eggs?</p>\n<p>Well, one thing that’s always frustrated me about this question is that it assumes one thing: that it SHOULD <em>eventually</em> be acceptable.</p>\n<p>And you know what I think?</p>\n<p><strong>That’s fucking BULLSHIT.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me explain why.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8856/0*mS5Ydm5ThKriHj77\"><figcaption>Photo by Timo Stern on Unsplash</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Would you ever fart on your first date with someone? No. Why? Because you want impress them, to make a good first impression on them, right? To appear sexy to them, right?</p>\n<p>Well, let me ask you this. Do you no longer want to impress your significant/other, your wife or husband? Is it no longer necessary to appear sexy to them, because you’ve been with them “long enough?” Well, this is my answer: HELL NO.</p>\n<p>I’d like to be sexy to my significant other forever. I don’t think farting is sexy, so until the day I die, I’m holding that shit in (forgive the pun). I do think puns are sexy, however, so those I let loose 😏.</p>\n<p>When I accidentally fart in my sleep, at least it’s a funny accident and we can laugh about it. But that version of the future where we just let farts loose mid-conversation and it’s no big deal and we just accept it as life? Because we’re “comfortable”? Screw that. That’s complacent. That’s my nightmare come true.</p>\n<h3>Don’t be complacent.</h3>\n<p>Keep dating your significant other. Keep being sexy, whatever your definition of sexy may be — forever.</p>\n<h2>🕺</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"I made a Lifetime Commitment to Never Fart in Front of my Significant Other, and You Should Too","date":"December 28, 2019","emoji":"💩","description":"A pretty common but controversial conversation amongst couples is this question of “How soon is too soon to start farting in front of your significant other?” Is 6 months too soon?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/i-made-a-lifetime-commitment-to-never-fart-in-front-of-my-significant-other-and-you-should-too/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2-months-ago-i-started-meditating-everyday-heres-why/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2 months ago, I started meditating everyday.
