About 20 years ago, Amel Larrieux wrote what I still believe to this day is the most endearing love song of all time: “Make Me Whole.”

Perfection — it is one of those things that never *really* happens. Life is like a winding path; it ebbs and flows, like a see saw, only being at hypothetical balance for what may appear to be an infinitesimally small moment in time. Perfection feels unattainable, yet the endless pursuit that follows it is always a worth living for.

If perfection could ever be captured in a bottle, this song is it.
